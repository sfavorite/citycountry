# City Country Latitude/Longitude API

## Description

This is a json/jsonp API to get City/Country in a type ahead search box and to get the Latitude & Longitude of a city based on the name.


## Outside

1. Laravel: The base framework for this application

2. Bing Maps for Latitude & Longitude (you could call this directly but since my weather app is public I didn't want my API key exposed)
